🚀 New Project Alert! 🌦️

I'm excited to share my latest web development project with you all! At ProDigy Infotech, I've created a dynamic web page that fetches real-time weather data based on the user's current location or a user-inputted location. 🌍

🔍 Key Features:

Allows users to input any location to retrieve specific weather data.
Displays weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
Clean and user-friendly interface designed for seamless interaction.
💡 This project showcases the powerful integration of web APIs with responsive web design, enhancing the user experience by providing real-time, location-specific information.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback! 😊
